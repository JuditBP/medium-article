        Habitat Where does the olive tree grow?
      </h2>
        <p class="description">The cultivated variant can be found within the Mediterranean area of influence of rainfed crops. The wild olive tree is the uncultivated variant (Olea europaea var. sylvestris) which grows wild in dry areas of the Mediterranean.
        </p>

      <h2 class="subheaders">Description of the olive tree</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Evergreen tree of the Oleaceae family, up to 15 m high, with a broad, long-lived crown, which can live for more than 1,500 years.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subheaders">Harvesting and preserving the olive tree</h2>
      <p class="description">
        The bark in spring. The leaves can be harvested all year round. They should be dried and stored in a dry, well-closed container. The olives in autumn or winter.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subheaders">Active components of the olive tree</h2>
      <ul class="description">
        <li>
          <strong>Polyphenols, secoiridoids or bitter iridoids</strong> (mainly in the leaves, less in the fruit and oil): mainly oleuropein (60-90 mg/g in the leaves), also known as oleuropeoside. In the intestine, oleuropein is degraded by the intestinal flora, releasing hydroxytyrosol (antioxidant and anti-inflammatory) and, according to some authors, elenolic acid or enolinate, with antimicrobial properties. Other secoiridoids present are: oleuroside, ligustroside, oleacin, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fats </strong>(fruits, oil): the fruit of the olive tree, the olives, can contain up to 30% of fats in their pulp. The oil is made up of 75% oleic acid, which is a type of monounsaturated fat (omega 9). Other abundant fatty acids in this oil, after oleic acid, are palmitic acid (11.5%) and linoleic acid (= omega 6) (7.5%).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Phospholipids </strong>(lecithins) (leaves, fruits, oil): choline.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin E</strong> (fruits, oil): there are different vitamers of this vitamin, olive contains mainly alpha-tocopherol and lesser amounts of gamma-tocopherol.</li>
        <li><strong>Bitter principle</strong> (leaves, fruits): olivamarin.</li>
        <li><strong>Tannins</strong> (bark, leaves, fruits)</li>
        <li><strong>Saponosides</strong>: oleoside, steroleoside</li>
        <li><strong>Sterols </strong>(fruits, oil): beta-sitosterol, squalene (hypocholesterolemic) (squalene is found in doses of 3.6 - 9.6 mg/gram of extra virgin olive oil)</li>
        <li><strong> Triterpenoid alcohols</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Flavonoids </strong>(leaves, fruit, oil): polyphenols, chlorophyll, carotenoids, olivine, apigenin heterosides, luteolin and rutin. They have a vitamin function, mainly as antioxidants. They are related to the golden green colour of virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Oleanolic, maslinic, ursolic acid</strong> (leaves) (hepatoprotective, antiarrhythmic).</li>
        <li><strong>Hexenal </strong>(responsible for the fruity taste of the oil).</li>
        <li><strong> Caffeic acid </strong>(higher content in green olives)</li>
        <li><strong>Verbascoside</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Melatonin</strong> (oil) (53-119 picogram per ml)</li>
      </ul>
